# Downscaled-Climate-Dataset-for-Alaska-and-Hawaii-Under-Historical-and-Future-Condition
Here we provide statistically downscaled and bias-corrected precipitation ('pr') and temperature ('tas') from CMIP6 GCMs for Alaska and Hawaii. We downscale the spatial resolutions to 10km for Alaska and 1km for Hawaii and use different bias correction methods, seven techniques for precipitation ('DQM','EQM','GPQM','QDM','Scaling','MVA','LOCI') and six for temperature ('DQM','EQM','QDM','Scaling','MVA','Variance'). The dataset covers both historical and future periods up to end of the 21st century (~2100) with four shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios (i.e., SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5; hereafter SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585).
